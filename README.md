# About Me
Hi! My name is Han Yang and this is my data portfolio. Currently, I'm learning data analysis and I hope I can land a job in this field. 

This repository serves as a means to showcase my skills, track my progress, document learnings and display my projects.

# Projects
Here are some projects which I have done. These projects focus on data cleaning via SQL, exploratory data analysis via Python in the form of Jupyter Notebooks and data visualisation with the help of Tableau. This repository will be used to display the code which I have written using Python and the dashboards can be found in my Tableau profile.
